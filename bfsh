.TH BFSH 1 "" "v.69" "BrainFuck SHell"
.SH NAME
BFSH \- An interactive command line shell for the Brainfuck language
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bfsh [-a] [-l TAPELENGTH] [-s]
.SH DESCRIPTION
BFSH is a command line shell that repeatedly accepts and evaluates user input as Brainfuck source code. The shell allows users to input Brainfuck source code, comments, and macro
procedures.
.SH USAGE
Usage of BFSH is rather straight-forward, for the most part. The user may provide Brainfuck source through keyboard input and bind names to text as procedures, allowing for a level
of
abstraction. The shell also makes use of the GNU readline library for usage of simple history functions and a peristent history file. When a given line of input ends with an opened loop, '[', a subprompt begins, delaying interpretation of all input. This subprompt is ended when a line contains a loop close, ']', at any point within, and interpretation resumes. Currently, nested loops may allow for undefined behavior when using this subprompt scheme. The shell will exit on ^D.
.SH MACROS
In accordance with proper Brainfuck interpretation, all non-Brainfuck
operations
are considered comments and not evaluated. Any 'comments' separated from other code by spaces may be used to define or call macro'd procedures. If the section of code is not a named procedure, it is processed as normal Brainfuck. Macros can be defined as [NAME=PROCEDURE], where NAME and PROCEDURE may be any combination of Brainfuck operations and other characters, ended with a space. NAME itself may even contain Brainfuck operations, though they won't be treated as such when used as a procedure; +=- is entirely valid. BFSH also comes with a few predefined macros to play with.
