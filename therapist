.SH NAME
therapist \- Interpret brainfuck source code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B therapist [-f FILEPATH] [-a] [-l TAPELENGTH] [-s]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Therapist is an interpreter and development environment for the Brainfuck programming language. It provides a collection of development tools 
for writing and interpreting brainfuck source code. Currently exists as a basic interpreter with some simple options. Some day will probably 
have a REPL shell and debuggers.
.SH OPTIONS
.B -a,
Enable ASCII input and output. IO will consider tape contents to be of type char. If KB input is longer than one char, only char[0] is used.

.B -s,
Enable unsigned tape contents. Machine will use an array of unsigned integers instead of normal.

.B -l [TAPELENGTH],
Define the length of the machine's tape. 30,000 if not provided. Tape currently does not wrap at end.

.B -f [FILEPATH],
Provide file with brainfuck source code to be interpreted, path is relative.
